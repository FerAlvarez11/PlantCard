Welcome to PlantCard. This is my first project working with React, it was very challenging but lots of fun to create.

[Demo page](https://feralvarez11.github.io/PlantCard/)

## Introduction

PlantCard is a website where you can track the watering time of your plants. Adding a plant is pretty straight forward. 
As you complete the three steps form in the 'add plant' section you'll be able to see the plant card you created in the 'plant-list' section. 

The plant card shows:
- How ofter the plant has to be watered
- Progress bar which changes as time passes
- The date that the plant has to be watered 
- Reset Button to restart the watering time
- Notes section

### Technologies that I used
- React
- Bulma
